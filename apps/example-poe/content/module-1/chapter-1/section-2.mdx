## Activity 2

Let’s think about a different comparison of two quantities.
<Scenario>
The school colors at Riverview Middle School are a shade of green and white. 
The art teacher, Mr. Raith, knows that to get the correct color of green, it takes 3 parts blue paint to every 2 parts yellow paint.
</Scenario>
There are different ways to think about this
relationship and make comparisons. One way is to
draw a picture or model.
From the model, you can make comparisons of the
different quantities. 
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
            - Blue parts to yellow parts
            - Yellow parts to blue parts
            </td>
            <td>
            - Blue parts to total parts
            - Yellow parts to total parts
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Each comparison is called a ratio. A **ratio** is a comparison of two quantities that uses
division. The comparisons in the first column are part-to-part ratios because you are
comparing the individual quantities. The comparisons in the second column are
part-to-whole ratios because you are comparing one of the parts to the total number
of parts.

<Scenario>
Suppose Mr. Raith needs 2 parts blue paint and 5 parts yellow paint to make
green paint.
</Scenario>

1. Compare the quantities of blue and yellow paint in Mr. Raith‘s mixture by writing all
possible ratios for each type. 

<Table
    rows={[
        ['a. Part-to-part ratios', 'b. Part-to-whole ratios'],
        ['What is the difference between the part-to-part ratios that you wrote?', 
        'What is the difference between the part-to-whole ratios that you wrote?'],
    ]}
