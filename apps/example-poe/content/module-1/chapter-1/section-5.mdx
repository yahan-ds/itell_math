title: "Special Types of Ratios"
---

Consider each statement:
- There is an 80 percent chance of rain tomorrow.
- Diego always gives 110%.
- Your battery is 50% charged.
- Joe received a 90% on a 10-question quiz.<div></div>

Each situation describes a special type of ratio called a percent. A **percent** is a part-to-whole ratio where the whole is equal to 100.
- Percent is another name for hundredths.
- The percent symbol “%” means “per 100,” or “out of 100.”

<Scenario variant="workedExample" imgSrc="/images/module-1/chapter-1/section-5/act5-1.png">

35% means 35 out of 100.<div></div>

**You can shade 35 of the 100 squares on the hundredths grid to represent 35%.**

</Scenario>

Write a fraction and a percent to represent the shaded part of each grid.<div></div>
Each hundredths grid represents a whole.
