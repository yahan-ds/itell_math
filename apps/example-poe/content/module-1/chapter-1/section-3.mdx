## Activity 3

You can find ratios all around you, even in your classroom! Just consider two different quantities. For example, how many students in your class wear glasses? How many students donâ€™t wear glasses?
1. Write a ratio to describe each given relationship.

<Table
    headers={['Part-to-part ratios', 'Part-to-whole ratios']}
    rows={[
        ['a. The number of students wearing glasses to the number of students not wearing glasses', 'b. The number of students wearing glasses to the total number of students'],
        ['c. The number of students not wearing glasses to the number of students wearing glasses', 
        'd. The number of students not wearing glasses to the total number of studentsWhat is the difference between the part-to-whole ratios that you wrote?'],

Let's go on a Ratio Hunt!

2. Search around your classroom for at least two pairs of quantities to compare.
For each pair:
- Identify the two quantities that you are comparing.
- Write all possible part-to-part and/or part-to-whole comparisons of the quantities.
- Identify each ratio as part-to-part or as part-to-whole.
- Be prepared to share your treasures from the Ratio Hunt with the class.

<Table
    rows={[
        ['a. Quantities being compared:', 'b. Quantities being compared:'],
        ['Ratio(s):', 'Ratio(s):'],
    ]}
/>
