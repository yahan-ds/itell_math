## Activity 2

In this activity, you will compare ratios by measuring or counting quantities. When you reason like this, it is called **quantitative reasoning**.

<Scenario>
The sixth-grade students are making hot chocolate to sell at the Winter Carnival. Each homeroom suggested a different recipe.

The “T” in each recipe stands for tablespoon!
</Scenario>

1. Consider the given recipes to answer each question.

    a. Use reasoning to determine which recipe has the strongest chocolate taste and which recipe has the weakest chocolate taste.
    
    b. Show how you used ratio reasoning to order the recipes. Identify the ratios that you used as part-to-part or part-to-whole.
    
    c. Create a poster to explain your answer and strategies to the class. Prepare to share.
