## Activity 1

In this activity, you will compare ratios without measuring or counting quantities. When you reason like this, it is called **qualitative reasoning**.

2. Dave and Sandy each made a pitcher of orange drink. Sandy’s pitcher is larger than Dave’s pitcher. Sandy used more orange mix than Dave. Dave’s orange drink has:
- A stronger-tasting orange flavor
- A weaker-tasting orange flavor
- A mix that has the same strength of orange taste as Sandy’s drink

3. If a race car travels more laps in less time than it did yesterday, its speed would be:
