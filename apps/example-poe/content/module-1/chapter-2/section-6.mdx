</Scenario>

### PRACTICE
Megan is making fruit punch using fruit juice and ginger ale. She tries different combinations to get the mixture just right. If the ratio of fruit juice to ginger ale is too high, the punch is too fruity; if the ratio is too low, the punch is too gingery.
1.  For each attempt, write a ratio Megan can try next time.

    a. She tried 16 cups of fruit juice and 4 cups of ginger ale. That was too fruity.

    b. She tried 10 cups of fruit juice and 8 cups of ginger ale. That was too gingery.

    c. She tried 10 cups of fruit juice and 1 cup of ginger ale. That was too fruity.

    d. She tried 8 cups of fruit juice and 4 cups of ginger ale. That was a little too gingery.

2. Based on Meganâ€™s attempts in parts (a) through (d), what might be a good ratio of fruit punch to ginger ale? Explain your thinking
