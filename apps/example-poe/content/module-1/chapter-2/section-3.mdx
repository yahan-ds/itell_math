## Activity 3

<Scenario>
The Parent-Teacher Association bought lemon-lime soda and pineapple juice to combine for the punch, but they did not say how much of each to use. Several students submitted suggestions for how to make the tastiest punch.
</Scenario>

> Cut out the punch ratio cards on page 189.

1. Order the cards from the least lemon-lime concentration to the most lemon-lime concentration. If you think more than one card describes the same ratio of lemon-lime soda and pineapple juice, group those cards together.
