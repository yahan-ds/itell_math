## Talk The Talk

<Scenario>
A soccer team was awarded a penalty shot at the end of a tie game. If the team makes the penalty shot, it will win the league championship. The coach is considering three players to take the penalty.
- Amber has taken 4 penalty shots this season and has made 3 of them. 
- Lindsay has taken 6 penalty shots and made 4.
- Li has taken 3 penalty shots and made 2.
</Scenario>

1. Which player would you recommend taking the penalty shot? Explain your choice.

2. How could you change just the number of shots taken for each player so that they all have the same ratio of shots made to shots taken?
