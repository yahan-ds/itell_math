### Review
> Answer each question.
1. Laquan put \$15 in savings this week. This was \$3 more than the amount he put in savings last week. How much did Laquan put in savings
last week?
2. Joanne bought three times as many books as Mitchell at the book fair. If Mitchell bought 5 books, how many books did Joanne buy?
