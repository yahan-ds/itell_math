### PRACTICE
The Lewis brothers joined a club that provides them with free movies based on a list that they pre-select. The boys pick the first 10 movies for their list by choosing their favorite type of movie. John David puts 5 sports movies on the list; Parker chooses 3 sci-fi movies; and Stephen adds 2 comedies.

1. Write the ratio in colon and in fractional form to express each relationship.

<Table
  rows={[
    ['a. Sports movies to sci-fi movies', 'b. Comedies to total movies'],
    ['c. Sci-fi movies to comedies', 'd. Sports movies to total movies'],
    ['e. Comedies to sports movies', 'f. Sci-fi movies to total movies'],
  ]}
/>

2. Identify which of the ratios in Question 1 are part-to-part ratios and which are part-to-whole ratios.
