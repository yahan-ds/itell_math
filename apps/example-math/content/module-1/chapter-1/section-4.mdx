title: "Making Sense of Ratios"
---

In this activity, you will represent ratios in different ways.
<Scenario>
The Lanterton Middle School is adopting a new nickname. They have narrowed their search to the following two names: **Tigers** or **Lions**. To choose a nickname, they conducted a school-wide survey and tallied all the votes.
</Scenario>
Each homeroom analyzed the results of the school-wide survey and reported the results
in a different way.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>**School-Wide Survey Results**</div>
<Table
    rows={[
        ['Homeroom 6A', 'Homeroom 6B'],
        ['The votes for Tigers outnumbered the votes for Lions by a ratio of 240 to 160.','There were 80 more votes for Tigers than Lions.'],
        ['Homeroom 7A', 'Homeroom 7B'],
        ['The votes for Tigers outnumbered votes for Lions by a ratio of 3 to 2.', '3 out of 5 votes were for Tigers.'] 
    ]}
    textAlign="center"
/>

1. Describe the meaning of each statement. Then, identify which describe ratios and if
so, whether the ratios are part-to-part or part-to-whole ratios.
<Scenario variant="workedExample">
Let’s consider the results reported by Homeroom 7A: “The votes for Tigers outnumbered votes for Lions by
a ratio of 3 to 2.”
This comparison is an example of a part-to-part ratio expressed in words. There are two other ways you can express this part-to-part ratio.

**With a Colon**<div></div>
3 votes for Tigers : 2 votes for Lions<div></div>
**In Fractional Form**
<div style={{ display: 'inline-block', textAlign: 'center', lineHeight: '1.2' }}>
  <span>3 votes for Tigers</span>
  <hr style={{ border: 'none', borderTop: '1px solid black', margin: '5px 0' }} />
  <span>2 votes for Lions</span>
</div>
</Scenario>

Next, let’s consider the results of the student vote as reported by
Homeroom 7B: “3 out of 5 votes were for Tigers.”

2. Complete the part-to-part and part-to-whole ratios written in words. Then, write each
ratio with a colon and in fractional form. **Label all quantities.**

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>**Part-to-Part Ratio**</div>

<Table textAlign={'center'} bordered={true}
  headers={['In Words', 'With a Colon', 'In Fractional Form']}
  rows={[
    ['(  ) votes for Tigers for every 2 votes for Lions', '', ''],
    ['2 votes for Lions for every (  ) votes for Tigers', '', '']
  ]}
/>

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>**Part-to-Whole Ratio**</div>

<Table textAlign={'center'} bordered={true}
  headers={['In Words', 'With a Colon', 'In Fractional Form']}
  rows={[
    ['3 out of 5 votes were for Tigers.', '', ''],
    ['(  ) out of 5 votes were for Lions.', '', '']
  ]}
/>

Finally, let’s consider the results of the survey as reported by Homeroom 6A: “The votes
for Tigers outnumbered the votes for Lions by a ratio of 240 to 160.”

3. Complete the part-to-part and part-to-whole ratios written in words. Then, write each
ratio with a colon and in fractional form. **Label all quantities.**

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>**Part-to-Part Ratio**</div>

<Table textAlign={'center'} bordered={true}
  headers={['In Words', 'With a Colon', 'In Fractional Form']}
  rows={[
    ['(  ) votes for Tigers,  (  ) votes for Lions', '', ''],
    ['(  ) votes for Lions,  (  ) votes for Tigers', '', '']
  ]}
/>

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>**Part-to-Whole Ratio**</div>

<Table textAlign={'center'} bordered={true} 
  headers={['In Words', 'With a Colon', 'In Fractional Form']}
  rows={[
    ['(  ) votes out of (  ) votes were for Tigers.', '', ''],
    ['(  ) votes out of (  ) votes were for Lions.', '', '']
  ]}
/>

4. Based on the survey, which mascot name did the students prefer?
