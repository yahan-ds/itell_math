title: "Additive and Multiplicative Reasoning"

<Scenario>
Robena and Eryn each predicted the final score of a basketball game between the Crusaders and the Blue Jays.
</ Scenario>
1. Analyze each prediction.

<QuestionInputProps 
    question = "a. Describe the reasoning that Robena and Eryn used to make each statement."
></QuestionInputProps>

<QuestionInputProps
    question = "b. Based on the two predictions, which team scored more points in the second half?"
></QuestionInputProps>

One of the students used additive reasoning to make her comparison and the other
used multiplicative reasoning. **Additive reasoning** focuses on the use of addition
and subtraction for comparisons. **Multiplicative reasoning** focuses on the use of
multiplication and division.
<QuestionInputProps question = 
    "Which student used additive reasoning and which used multiplicative reasoning?"
></QuestionInputProps>
Read the age scenario and answer each question.

<Scenario>
Vicki and her nephew Benjamin share the same birthday. They were both born on March 4.
**Vicki**: "Today, I'm 40 years old and you're 10. I'm 4 times as old as you are!"
**Benjamin**: "Wow, you're old!"
**Vicki**: "Yeah, but in 5 years, I'll be 45 and you'll be 15. Then, I will only be three times as old as you."
**Benjamin**: "I'm catching up to you!"
**Vicki**: "And 15 years after that, I'll be 60 and you'll be 30. Then, I'll only be twice as old as you!"
**Benjamin**: "In enough time, I'll be older than you, Aunt Vicki!"
</Scenario>

2. Is Vicki correct about how their ages change? Is Benjamin correct in thinking that he
will eventually be older than his aunt?"

3. The table shown represents the different statements between Vicki and Benjamin.
Let V represent Vicki’s age and B represent Benjamin’s age.

a. Complete the last column by identifying each relationship as either additive or
multiplicative.
<QuestionInputProps question = "b. At any point in this age scenario, which relationship does not change?"
